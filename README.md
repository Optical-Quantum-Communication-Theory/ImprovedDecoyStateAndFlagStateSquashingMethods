# Improved Decoy-state and Flag-state Squashing Methods

This is a public version of the code used in Improved Decoy-state and Flag-state Squashing Methods \[[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05069)\]. This was built for a modified version of openQKDsecurity v1.0 and all changes have been included in this repository.

## Figure Instructions

The functions below are required to generate the plots in the paper. For each plot we describe below which settings need to be chosen. For all plots the change from two to one decoy intensity is done as follows
1. Comment out the parameters with two decoy intensities in the preset file,
2. Comment out the variable names with two decoy intesities in the channel module,
3. Comment out the variable 'decoys' containing two decoy intensities in the channel module.

Here are the specific minor modificaitons required to reproduce the data of figures in the paper.

### Figure 1
Requires functions `Main_BB84` and `pmBB84WCP_nodecoy` for the correct parameters. For comparing different decoy methods, in the `pmBB84WCP_nodecoy` preset change the channel model to `pmBB84WCPChannel_constr_nodecoy` for the yellow triangles, and to `pmBB84WCPChannel_Choi_nodecoy` for the red circles. 

### Figure 2
Requires functions `Main_BB84` and `pmBB84WCP_decoy` for the correct parameters. To recreate the curves using the decoy-state methods from Wang et.al. [4] change the channel to `pmBB84WCPChannel` (green diamonds and red circles) and comment out the decoy intensities appropriately. For the improved decoy methods (yellow stars) choose `pmBB84WCPChannel_Choi` in the same preset and comment out the decoy intensities appropriately.

### Figure 3
This uses the same data as in figure 2.

### Figure 7
Requires functions `Main_SixState` and `pmSixStateWCP_decoy` for the correct parameters of the qubit squasher [2, 3]. The channel models `pmSixStateWCPChannel` or `pmSixStateWCPChannel_improved_decoy` implement the decoy methods from Ref [4] and the improved decoy methods decoy methods, respectively. To change the number of decoy intensities comment out the intensities as described above. The files `Main_SixState_Flag` and `pmSixStateLossyDescription_Flag_Reduced` with the parameters $p_z^A = \dots = p_y^A = p_z^B = \dots = p_y^B = \frac{1}{3}$ are required for the flag-state squasher. The improved decoy methods from  `pmSixStateWCPChannel_Flag_improved` create the curve corresponding to the flag-state squasher (red diamonds). Since this plot uses two decoy intensities a almost indistinguishable curve can be generated using the decoy methods from Ref [4] in `pmSixStateWCPChannel_Flag_Reduced`. To switch between any of these channel models they need to be commented out appropriately in the presets.

### Figure 8
`Main_SixState_Flag` and `pmSixStateLossyDescription_Flag_Reduced` with $p_z^A= p_z^B = 0.8, p_y^A = p_y^B = p_x^A = p_x^B = 0.1$ setup the protocol using the flag-state squasher. The channel module `pmSixStateWCPChannel_Flag_improved` creates the curve corresponding to the improved decoy methods (red stars) and the channel module `pmSixStateWCPChannel_Flag_Reduced` is used for the standard decoy methods [4], creating the curve with green circles. Again, in the preset the channel modules and intensities have to be commented out appropriately.

### Figure 9
`Main_SixState_Flag` and `pmSixStateLossyDescription_Flag_Reduced` with $p_z^A= p_z^B = 0.8, p_y^A = p_y^B = p_x^A = p_x^B = 0.1$ while commenting out all unncessary decoy intensities sets up the protocol. The channel modules `pmSixStateWCPChannel_Flag_improved` and `pmSixStateWCPChannel_Flag_nodecoy` create the curves using the improved decoy methods from this work and applying $e_0 = 1/2$ from Rusca et. al. [1], respectively.

### Figure 10
This figure requires `Main_SixState_Flag` with the preset `pmSixStateWCP_decoy_Flag_dif_int` while setting $p_z^A = \dots = p_y^A = p_z^B = \dots = p_y^B = \frac{1}{3}$. The description file `pmSixStateLossyDescription_Flag_dif_int` and the channel `pmSixStateWCPChannel_Flag_dif_int` are create the curve **without** a bit bias. The description file `pmSixStateLossyDescription_Flag_bit_bias` and the channel `pmSixStateWCPChannel_Flag_bit_bias` create the curve **with** a bit bias. In both channel modules one can switch between improved decoy methods and standard decoy methods [4] by commenting out the lines 128 (w/o bit bias) or 109 (with bit bias).

### Figure 11
This figure uses the same data as figure 10, but each key rate curve is divided by the sigle photon probability.
